# TILE
TILE is a game engine designed for tile-based 2D games, and offers many abstractions to aid in the development of such games. Games that could be implemented in this engine include titles such as: Pok√©mon, Terraria, Starbound, and Minesweeper. The World is composed of 4 main layers: The Background Layer, The Tilemap Layer, The Animate (Living) Layer, and The Interface Layer. The layers are drawn to the screen with the Background Layer at the bottom of the visual stack, and Interface layer on the top. Due to the partial transparency of the upper layers, the 4 main layers appear to be interwoven, and produce a constant image. It is because of the similar geometry throughout the Tilemap Layer that the world is said to be tessellated.  The world is far to big, however, to view all at once, so the player observes and interacts with the world through an SFML View. The player is simply an entity with an SFML View centered over it.
